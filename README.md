# **Assalamu Alaikum!**

We, the HooPow family, are looking for new talents to help us in achieving what we believe is a lofty goal. 

As HooPow, we are aiming to provide a platform for the children to learn their values, have a comprehensive understanding of fundamental tenets of Islam, and to be able to enjoy in their halaal internet zones. 

In our platform, they share, they play, they learn, and they grow. 

As you can imagine, this endeavor is as demanding as it is rewarding. Hence, if you believe you have the potential to contribute to this endeavor with your React skills, we invite you to join us üí™üèª
